     *  Given a date, returns a `TimeChunk` with components in their most natural form. Example:
     *
     *  ```
     *  let formatter = DateFormatter()
     *  formatter.dateFormat = "yyyy MM dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"
     *  let birthday = formatter.date(from: "2015 11 24 14:50:12.000")!
     *  let age = birthday.chunkBetween(date: formatter.date(from: "2016 10 07 15:27:12.000")!)
     *  ```
     *
     *  The age variable will have a chunk of time with year, month, day, hour, minute, 
     *  and second components (note that we do not use weeks since they are not components 
     *  of `Calendar`). So if you just wanted the age in years, you could then say: age.years.
     *
     *  The chunk is calculated exactly as you'd say it in real life, always converting up 
     *  when a lower unit equals 1 of the unit above it. The above example returns 
     *  `TimeChunk(seconds: 0, minutes: 37, hours: 0, days: 13, weeks: 0, months: 10, years: 0)`.
     *
     *  Passing a future date returns a TimeChunk with all positive components and passing 
     *  a date in the past returns one with all negative components.
     *
     *  - parameter date: The date of reference from the date called on
     *
     *  - returns: A TimeChunk representing the time between the dates, in natural form
